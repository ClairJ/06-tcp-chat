## Whiteboard Challenge 06

Complete today's whiteboard challenge and follow the submission instructions below:

1. *Write a recursive function called loop that has the function signature*
     `(count, callback) => undefined`
      It should call the `callback` `count` times (`count` is expected to be > 0)

<!-- 2. *Write a function that takes a function as its only argument and returns a new function.*
    *This new function can be called an infinite amount of times, but it will only execute the original function on the first call.* -->
